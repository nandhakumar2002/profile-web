              &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; A real-time river water quality monitoring and control system is a system designed to continuously monitor the water quality in a river and make changes to maintain its quality. It uses sensors to measure various parameters, a data collection system to gather the data, a data analysis software to provide real-time information, and a control system to adjust the water quality as needed. The goal is to ensure the water is safe for human consumption, recreation, and other uses.
